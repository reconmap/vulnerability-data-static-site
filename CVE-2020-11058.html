<h1>CVE-2020-11058</h1>
<p>In FreeRDP after 1.1 and before 2.0.0, a stream out-of-bounds seek in rdp_read_font_capability_set could lead to a later out-of-bounds read. As a result, a manipulated client or server might force a disconnect due to an invalid data read. This has been fixed in 2.0.0.</p>
