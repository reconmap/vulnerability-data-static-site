<h1>CVE-2020-12000</h1>
<p>The affected product is vulnerable to the handling of serialized data. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data on the Ignition 8 Gateway (versions prior to 8.0.10) and Ignition 7 Gateway (versions prior to 7.9.14), allowing an attacker to obtain sensitive information.</p>
