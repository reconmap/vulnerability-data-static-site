<h1>CVE-2020-11512</h1>
<p>Stored XSS in the IMPress for IDX Broker WordPress plugin before 2.6.2 allows authenticated attackers with minimal (subscriber-level) permissions to save arbitrary JavaScript in the plugin's settings panel via the idx_update_recaptcha_key AJAX action and a crafted idx_recaptcha_site_key parameter, which would then be executed in the browser of any administrator visiting the panel. This could be used to create new administrator-level accounts.</p>
