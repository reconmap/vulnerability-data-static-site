<h1>CVE-2020-25073</h1>
<p>FreedomBox through 20.13 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from the /server-status page of the Apache HTTP Server, because a connection from the Tor onion service (or from PageKite) is considered a local connection. This affects both the freedombox and plinth packages of some Linux distributions, but only if the Apache mod_status module is enabled.</p>
