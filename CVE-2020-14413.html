<h1>CVE-2020-14413</h1>
<p>NeDi 1.9C is vulnerable to XSS because of an incorrect implementation of sanitize() in inc/libmisc.php. This function attempts to escape the SCRIPT tag from user-controllable values, but can be easily bypassed, as demonstrated by an onerror attribute of an IMG element as a Devices-Config.php?sta= value.</p>
