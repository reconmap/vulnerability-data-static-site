<h1>CVE-2020-10236</h1>
<p>An issue was discovered in Froxlor before 0.10.14. It created files with static names in /tmp during installation if the installation directory was not writable. This allowed local attackers to cause DoS or disclose information out of the config files, because of _createUserdataConf in install/lib/class.FroxlorInstall.php.</p>
