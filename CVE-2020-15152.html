<h1>CVE-2020-15152</h1>
<p>ftp-srv versions 1.0.0 through 4.3.3 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery. The PORT command allows arbitrary IPs which can be used to cause the server to make a connection elsewhere. A possible workaround is blocking the PORT through the configuration. This issue is fixed in version 4.3.4. More information can be found on the linked advisory.</p>
