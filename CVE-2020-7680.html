<h1>CVE-2020-7680</h1>
<p>docsify prior to 4.11.4 is susceptible to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). Docsify.js uses fragment identifiers (parameters after # sign) to load resources from server-side .md files. Due to lack of validation here, it is possible to provide external URLs after the /#/ (domain.com/#//attacker.com) and render arbitrary JavaScript/HTML inside docsify page.</p>
