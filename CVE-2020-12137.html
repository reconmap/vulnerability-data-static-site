<h1>CVE-2020-12137</h1>
<p>GNU Mailman 2.x before 2.1.30 uses the .obj extension for scrubbed application/octet-stream MIME parts. This behavior may contribute to XSS attacks against list-archive visitors, because an HTTP reply from an archive web server may lack a MIME type, and a web browser may perform MIME sniffing, conclude that the MIME type should have been text/html, and execute JavaScript code.</p>
