<h1>CVE-2020-15719</h1>
<p>libldap in certain third-party OpenLDAP packages has a certificate-validation flaw when the third-party package is asserting RFC6125 support. It considers CN even when there is a non-matching subjectAltName (SAN). This is fixed in, for example, openldap-2.4.46-10.el8 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
