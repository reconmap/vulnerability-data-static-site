<h1>CVE-2020-25249</h1>
<p>An issue was discovered in Hyland OnBase through 18.0.0.32 and 19.x through 19.8.9.1000. The server typically logs activity only when a client application specifies that logging is desired. This can be problematic for use cases in a regulated industry, where server-side logging is required in additional situations.</p>
