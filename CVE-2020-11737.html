<h1>CVE-2020-11737</h1>
<p>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Web Client in Zimbra 9.0 allows a remote attacker to craft links in an E-Mail message or calendar invite to execute arbitrary JavaScript. The attack requires an A element containing an href attribute with a "www" substring (including the quotes) followed immediately by a DOM event listener such as onmouseover. This is fixed in 9.0.0 Patch 2.</p>
