<h1>CVE-2020-8808</h1>
<p>The CorsairLLAccess64.sys and CorsairLLAccess32.sys drivers in CORSAIR iCUE before 3.25.60 allow local non-privileged users (including low-integrity level processes) to read and write to arbitrary physical memory locations, and consequently gain NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges, via a function call such as MmMapIoSpace.</p>
