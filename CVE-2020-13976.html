<h1>CVE-2020-13976</h1>
<p>** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in DD-WRT through 16214. The Diagnostic page allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the host field of the ping command. Exploitation through CSRF might be possible. NOTE: software maintainers consider the report invalid because it refers to an old software version, requires administrative privileges, and does not provide access beyond that already available to administrative users.</p>
