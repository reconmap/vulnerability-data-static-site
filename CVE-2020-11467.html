This product enables administrators to modify the helpdesk interface by editing /portal/api/style/edit-theme-set/template-sources theme templates, and uses TWIG as its template engine. While direct access to self and _self variables was not permitted, one could abuse the accessible variables in one's context to reach a native unserialize function via the code parameter. There, on could pass a crafted payload to trigger a set of POP gadgets in order to achieve remote code execution.</p>
