<h1>CVE-2020-24051</h1>
<p>The Moog EXO Series EXVF5C-2 and EXVP7C2-3 units support the ONVIF interoperability IP-based physical security protocol, which requires authentication for some of its operations. It was found that the authentication check for those ONVIF operations can be bypassed. An attacker can abuse this issue to execute privileged operations without authentication, for instance, to create a new Administrator user.</p>
