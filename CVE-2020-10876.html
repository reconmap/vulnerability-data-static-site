<h1>CVE-2020-10876</h1>
<p>The OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3) does not correctly implement its timeout on the four-digit verification code that is required for resetting passwords, nor does it properly restrict excessive verification attempts. This allows an attacker to brute force the four-digit verification code in order to bypass email verification and change the password of a victim account.</p>
