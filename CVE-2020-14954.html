<h1>CVE-2020-14954</h1>
<p>Mutt before 1.14.4 and NeoMutt before 2020-06-19 have a STARTTLS buffering issue that affects IMAP, SMTP, and POP3. When a server sends a "begin TLS" response, the client reads additional data (e.g., from a man-in-the-middle attacker) and evaluates it in a TLS context, aka "response injection."</p>
