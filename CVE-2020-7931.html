<h1>CVE-2020-7931</h1>
<p>In JFrog Artifactory 5.x and 6.x, insecure FreeMarker template processing leads to remote code execution, e.g., by modifying a .ssh/authorized_keys file. Patches are available for various versions between 5.11.8 and 6.16.0. The issue exists because use of the DefaultObjectWrapper class makes certain Java functions accessible to a template.</p>
