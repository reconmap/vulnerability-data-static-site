<h2>Vulnerability Data</h2>
<h1>CVE-2020-3193</h1>
<p>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information about an affected device. The vulnerability exists because replies from the web-based management interface include unnecessary server information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inspecting replies received from the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain details about the operating system, including the web server version that is running on the device, which could be used to perform further attacks.</p>
