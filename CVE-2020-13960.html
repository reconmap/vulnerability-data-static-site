<h1>CVE-2020-13960</h1>
<p>D-Link DSL 2730-U IN_1.10 and IN_1.11 and DIR-600M 3.04 devices have the domain.name string in the DNS resolver search path by default, which allows remote attackers to provide valid DNS responses (and also offer Internet services such as HTTP) for names that otherwise would have had an NXDOMAIN error, by registering a subdomain of the domain.name domain name.</p>
