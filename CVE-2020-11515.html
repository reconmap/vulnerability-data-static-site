<h1>CVE-2020-11515</h1>
<p>The Rank Math plugin through 1.0.40.2 for WordPress allows unauthenticated remote attackers to create new URIs (that redirect to an external web site) via the unsecured rankmath/v1/updateRedirection REST API endpoint. In other words, this is not an "Open Redirect" issue; instead, it allows the attacker to create a new URI with an arbitrary name (e.g., the /exampleredirect URI).</p>
