<h1>CVE-2020-3372</h1>
<p>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to consume excessive system memory and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to inefficient memory management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of crafted HTTP requests to the affected web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory, which could cause the system to stop processing new connections and could result in a DoS condition.</p>
