<h1>CVE-2020-8634</h1>
<p>Wing FTP Server v6.2.3 for Linux, macOS, and Solaris sets insecure permissions on files modified within the HTTP file management interface, resulting in files being saved with world-readable and world-writable permissions. If a sensitive system file were edited this way, a low-privilege user may escalate privileges to root.</p>
