<h2>Vulnerability Data</h2>
<h1>CVE-2020-3518</h1>
<p>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of the affected software. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</p>
