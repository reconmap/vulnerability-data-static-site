<h1>CVE-2020-24613</h1>
<p>wolfSSL before 4.5.0 mishandles TLS 1.3 server data in the WAIT_CERT_CR state, within SanityCheckTls13MsgReceived() in tls13.c. This is an incorrect implementation of the TLS 1.3 client state machine. This allows attackers in a privileged network position to completely impersonate any TLS 1.3 servers, and read or modify potentially sensitive information between clients using the wolfSSL library and these TLS servers.</p>
