<p>An issue was discovered in signotec signoPAD-API/Web (formerly Websocket Pad Server) before 3.1.1 on Windows. It is possible to perform a Denial of Service attack because the implementation doesn't limit the parsing of nested JSON structures. If a victim visits an attacker-controlled website, this vulnerability can be exploited via WebSocket data with a deeply nested JSON array.</p>
