<h2>Vulnerability Data</h2>
<h1>CVE-2019-1605</h1>
<p>A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code as root. The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation in the NX-API feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP or HTTPS request to an internal service on an affected device that has the NX-API feature enabled.
