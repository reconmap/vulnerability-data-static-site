<h2>Vulnerability Data</h2>
<h1>CVE-2019-12693</h1>
<p>A vulnerability in the Secure Copy (SCP) feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the use of an incorrect data type for a length variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating the transfer of a large file to an affected device via SCP. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid privilege level 15 credentials on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the length variable to roll over, which could cause the affected device to crash.</p>
