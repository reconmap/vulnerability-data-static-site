<h2>Vulnerability Data</h2>
<h1>CVE-2019-18188</h1>
<p>Trend Micro Apex One could be exploited by an attacker utilizing a command injection vulnerability to extract files from an arbitrary zip file to a specific folder on the Apex One server, which could potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE). The remote process execution is bound to the IUSR account, which has restricted permission and is unable to make major system changes. An attempted attack requires user authentication.</p>
