title: "CVE-2020-12051"
description: "The CentralAuth extension through REL1_34 for MediaWiki allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive hidden account information via an api.php?action=query&meta=globaluserinfo&guiuser= request. In other words, the information can be retrieved via the action API even though access would be denied when simply visiting wiki/Special:CentralAuth in a web browser."
