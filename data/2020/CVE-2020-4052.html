title: "CVE-2020-4052"
description: "In Wiki.js before 2.4.107, there is a stored cross-site scripting through template injection. This vulnerability exists due to an insecure validation mechanism intended to insert v-pre tags into rendered HTML elements which contain curly-braces. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. This has been patched in 2.4.107."
