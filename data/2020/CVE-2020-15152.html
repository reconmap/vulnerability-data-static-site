title: "CVE-2020-15152"
description: "ftp-srv versions 1.0.0 through 4.3.3 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery. The PORT command allows arbitrary IPs which can be used to cause the server to make a connection elsewhere. A possible workaround is blocking the PORT through the configuration. This issue is fixed in version 4.3.4. More information can be found on the linked advisory."
