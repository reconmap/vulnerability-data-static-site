description: "Havoc Research discovered an authenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the JSON data source of Redash open-source 8.0.0 and prior. Possibly, other connectors are affected. The SSRF is potent and provides a lot of flexibility in terms of being able to craft HTTP requests e.g., by adding headers, selecting any HTTP verb, etc."
