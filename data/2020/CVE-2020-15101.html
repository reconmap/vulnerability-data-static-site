title: "CVE-2020-15101"
description: "In freewvs before 0.1.1, a directory structure of more than 1000 nested directories can interrupt a freewvs scan due to Python's recursion limit and os.walk(). This can be problematic in a case where an administrator scans the dirs of potentially untrusted users. This has been patched in 0.1.1."
