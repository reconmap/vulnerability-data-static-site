title: "CVE-2020-14001"
description: "The kramdown gem before 2.3.0 for Ruby processes the template option inside Kramdown documents by default, which allows unintended read access (such as template=/etc/passwd) or unintended embedded Ruby code execution (such as a string that begins with template=string://<%= `). NOTE: kramdown is used in Jekyll, GitLab Pages, GitHub Pages, and Thredded Forum."
