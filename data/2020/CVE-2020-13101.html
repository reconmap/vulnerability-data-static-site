title: "CVE-2020-13101"
description: "In OASIS Digital Signature Services (DSS) 1.0, an attacker can control the validation outcome (i.e., trigger either a valid or invalid outcome for a valid or invalid signature) via a crafted XML signature, when the InlineXML option is used. This defeats the expectation of non-repudiation."
