title: "CVE-2020-13757"
description: "Python-RSA before 4.1 ignores leading '\\0' bytes during decryption of ciphertext. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact, e.g., by helping an attacker to infer that an application uses Python-RSA, or if the length of accepted ciphertext affects application behavior (such as by causing excessive memory allocation)."
