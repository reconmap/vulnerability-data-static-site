<h1>CVE-2020-12421</h1>
<p>When performing add-on updates, certificate chains terminating in non-built-in-roots were rejected (even if they were legitimately added by an administrator.) This could have caused add-ons to become out-of-date silently without notification to the user. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.10, Firefox < 78, and Thunderbird < 68.10.0.</p>
