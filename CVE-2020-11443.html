<h1>CVE-2020-11443</h1>
<p>The Zoom IT installer for Windows (ZoomInstallerFull.msi) prior to version 4.6.10 deletes files located in %APPDATA%\Zoom before installing an updated version of the client. Standard users are able to write to this directory, and can write links to other directories on the machine. As the installer runs with SYSTEM privileges and follows these links, a user can cause the installer to delete files that otherwise cannot be deleted by the user.</p>
