<h2>Vulnerability Data</h2>
<h1>CVE-2020-3224</h1>
<p>A vulnerability in the web-based user interface (web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with read-only privileges to inject IOS commands to an affected device. The injected commands should require a higher privilege level in order to be executed. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of specific HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to a specific web UI endpoint on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject IOS commands to the affected device, which could allow the attacker to alter the configuration of the device or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.</p>
