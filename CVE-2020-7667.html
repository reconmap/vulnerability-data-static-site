<h1>CVE-2020-7667</h1>
<p>In package github.com/sassoftware/go-rpmutils/cpio before version 0.1.0, the CPIO extraction functionality doesn't sanitize the paths of the archived files for leading and non-leading ".." which leads in file extraction outside of the current directory. Note: the fixing commit was applied to all affected versions which were re-released.</p>
